Assignment Scope: Memory Management
1. First Fit Implementation:

b. Initialize all memory blocks as free.
c. Start by picking each process and check if it can be assigned to current block.
d. If size-of-process <= size-of-block if yes then assign and check for next process.
e. If not then keep checking the further blocks.
2. Best Fit Implementation:
a. Input memory blocks with size and processes with size.
b. Initialize all memory blocks as free.
c. Start by picking each process and find the minimum block size that can be assigned to
current process i.e., find min(blockSize[1], blockSize[2],.....blockSize[n]) >
processSize[current], if found then assign it to the current process.
d. If not, then leave that process and keep checking the further processes.
3. Worst Fit Implementation:
a. Input memory blocks with size and processes with size.
b. Initialize all memory blocks as free.
c. Start by picking each process and find the maximum block size that can be assigned to
current process i.e., find max(blockSize[1], blockSize[2],.....blockSize[n]) >
processSize[current], if found then assign it to the current process.
d. If not, then leave that process and keep checking the further processes.

4. Next Fit Implementation:
a. Input memory blocks with size and processes with size.
b. Initialize all memory blocks as free.

allocate it the required memory and check for next process but from the block where we
left not from starting.
